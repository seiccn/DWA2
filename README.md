Description of the project (2-3+ sentences):
XKCD Style Calculator:
The goal of the calculator is to generate passwords using a list in a database. You may specify the number of words and whether numbers, special chars and uppercase chars shall be used. The calculator uses uncommon non-gibberish base words and will generate a random phrase consisting of the number of words that you specified.

I have included a 2min demo and extensive comments. I did not really encounter problems and it was pretty smooth. In the end, I added the 50 words limit.
